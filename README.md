## How to Customize

- Colors: edit CSS variables at the top of `index.css` (`--accent-a`, `--accent-b`, `--bg1`).
- Profile image: replace `main image.png` or update the `src` in `index.html`.
- Links: update the `<a>` tags inside `.links-container` with your URLs and text.
- Tilt intensity: edit the rotation multiplier in `index.js` to adjust tilt strength.

Example snippet:

```html
<img src="main image.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic">
<h1 class="profile-name">@yourusername</h1>
<p class="bio">Short bio about you.</p>

<a href="https://your-link.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link-button">Your Link Title</a>
```

---

## Accessibility & Responsiveness

- Focus-visible styles for keyboard users.
- Tilt respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and is disabled on touch/small screens.
- Buttons use touch-friendly sizes (min-height >= 44px).

If you'd like, I can:

- Add SVG icons to the link buttons and update the README with usage.
- Create a `package.json` and an `npm start` script for easy local testing.
- Add a generated `screenshot.png` to the repo.

Tell me which you'd like next and I'll implement it.
